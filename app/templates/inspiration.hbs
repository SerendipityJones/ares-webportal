<h1>Inspiration</h1>

<p>No idea for where and when to set a scene when characters hop through a Portal or use a Key of which the destination is unknown? Look no further. This generator tries to suggest a combination of location and activity for using a Key or Portal with an unknown destination.</p>
<p>Not every suggestion is going to make sense in combination; you probably will not find a red carpet opera premiere on board a B52 bomber plane over Hamburg in '43. Pick the bits that inspire you and ignore the rest!</p>

<blockquote class="inspirationbox">
  <p>Your destination could be <AnsiFormat @text={{this.model.newLocation}} /></p>
  <p><AnsiFormat @text={{this.model.newAction}} /></p>
  <p>An involved item or trinket could be <AnsiFormat @text={{~this.model.newThing~}} /> Consider using a theme of <AnsiFormat @text={{this.model.newCue}} /></p>
